Stream One Project

 
### Aim?
 
For the purpose of the project, I decided to create a website for my own company, namely Code Klan LTD. Although I already have a website, the existing one is CMS based and therefore I would like to take this opportunity and create one from scratch.
 
### Functionalities?
 
This website will allow visitors to find out about the services provided by Code Klan, contact the company.

### CodePlayer (Interactive Component)

CodePlayer was created as part of another project which I was enrolled on a few months ago on Udemy.

### Used Languages

In order to create this website, I used Bootstrap and Jquery. This is because I find these two the most effective tools of creating a responsive and nice-looking platform. Using these two takes away the requirement of complicated coding process.
 
### Testing:

Creating this website did not require much testing as the Javascript used is pretty limited. However, in order to ensure that every part works as it should, I was checking the workability as the part was created. I used 'Brackets' to write my codes and its 'Live View' functionality has proved to be a great help to ensure that each part of the website is being built to the standard required.

### Motion Graphics:

The two videos/motion graphics used are from: https://www.videvo.net/free-motion-graphics/
